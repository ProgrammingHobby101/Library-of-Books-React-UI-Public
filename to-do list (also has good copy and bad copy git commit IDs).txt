(+)- pass props from bookcreate to modal component.
(+)- test hiding the Material UI ratings element, then see what the html input element.
- test if any of the StarOnChange values used in the function are null when using keyboard to control star ratings component.
(+)- need to copy youtube folder(for the react npm run deploy for production deploys)
- need to print in console the 400 error of PUT request in BookCreate
- need to add loading and success/failure status for delete request to BookList.
- BookCreate why do I have to hit the submit button twice to submit form request?
- round edges of all modals. 
(+)- need to refresh BookList
- check styles.css.
- possibly change the star ratings component to this one; https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-rating-component-in-reactjs/
(+)- delete gh-pages branch on the remote? looks like no because that branch is the one that works to deploy app to GitHub pages.
(+)- good copy;
